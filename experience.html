<h1> Talking about experiences, I have been working at a kids clothing store in the mall after school and on the weekends. I started working at an early age because my family needed the money. I would go to school full time and work part-time. I feel that I know the value of money due to my work experiences. Once I start working, it was really hard to stop or cut back on the income that I was earning.  I've always wanted to go back to work, but my mom was forcing me to further my studies.
