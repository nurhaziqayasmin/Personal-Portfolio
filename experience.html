<h1> My Experiences </h1>
<p>Talking about experiences, I have been working at a kids clothing store in the mall after school and on the weekends.</p>
<p>I started working at an early age because my family needed the money. </p>
<p>I would go to school full time and work part-time. </p>
<p>I feel that I know the value of money due to my work experiences. </p>
<p>Once I start working, it was really hard to stop or cut back on the income that I was earning. </p>
<p>I've always wanted to go back to work, but my mom was forcing me to further my studies. </p>
